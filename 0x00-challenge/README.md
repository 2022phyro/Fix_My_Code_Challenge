# Fix-my-code-0
To the point, here's what we did
* [0-fizzbuzz](./0-fizzbuzz.py)
Something was going wrong with my Fizz and wwe found out that the conditions were misplaced. _Python_
* [1-print_square](./1-print_square.js)
The parseint function is very sneaky and sad. i never knew it could be so dangerous when the wrong radix is used. _Javascript_
* [2-sort](./2-sort.rb)
I still can't get over my admiration for the fact that you could write regex like inline in ruby, but what's even cooler is that indexes matter in insertion sort. _Ruby_
* [3-user](./3-user.py)
Yeah another class of it's own literally. I still don't understand the hashlib and it's implications, but i do know that hexdigest.lower and hexdigest.upper are two different functions. _Python_
* [4-delete_dnodint](./4-delete_dnodeint/)

And that's our first challenge
